# CLI for Microsoft 365 Runscript
GitHub action to run a script using the CLI for Microsoft 365

![CLI for Microsoft 365 Runscript](./images/pnp-cli-microsoft365-blue.svg)

This GitHub Action (created using typescript) uses [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/), to run a line of script supplied to it or run code in a script file supplied to it.

## Usage
### Pre-requisites
Create a workflow `.yml` file in `.github/workflows` directory of your repo. An [example workflow](#example-workflow---cli-for-microsoft-365-runscript) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

## Dependencies on other GitHub Actions

- [CLI for Microsoft 365 Login](https://github.com/pnp/action-cli-login) â€“ **Required** . This action is dependant on `action-cli-login`. So in the workflow we need to run  `action-cli-login` before using this action.

#### Optional requirement
Since `action-cli-login` requires user name and password which are sensitive pieces of information, it would be ideal to store them securely. We can achieve this in a GitHub repo by using [secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets). So, click on `settings` tab in your repo and add 2 new secrets:
- `adminUsername` - store the admin user name in this (e.g. user@contoso.onmicrosoft.com)
- `adminPassword` - store the password of that user in this.
These secrets are encrypted and can only be used by GitHub actions.

### Inputs
- `CLI_MICROSOFT365_SCRIPT_PATH` : Relative path of the script in your repo.
- `CLI_MICROSOFT365_SCRIPT` : The script to run
- `IS_POWERSHELL` : `true|false` Used only with CLI_MICROSOFT365_SCRIPT. If true the assumption is the script passed in CLI_MICROSOFT365_SCRIPT will be a PowerShell script, otherwise the assumption is bash script. Default is false

One of `CLI_MICROSOFT365_SCRIPT_PATH` / `CLI_MICROSOFT365_SCRIPT` is mandatory, in case both are defined `CLI_MICROSOFT365_SCRIPT_PATH` gets preference.
